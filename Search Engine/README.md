## 🕸️ Search Engine Project

## 📘 Overview

This project implements a simplified web search engine that models how real-world search engines such as Google function internally.
It simulates web crawling, indexing, ranking, and searching using custom implementations of data structures and algorithms.

The system integrates:

- A custom hash table for fast lookups,
- A directed graph for web connectivity,
- Sorting algorithms for result organization,
- A simplified PageRank model for ranking web pages by relevance.

## 🎯 Key Learning Areas

- Graph Implementation & Traversal: Construction and exploration using BFS/DFS.
- Hash Table Design: Efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs.
- Algorithmic Sorting: Manual implementation of O(n log n) algorithms (e.g., MergeSort, QuickSort).
- PageRank Simulation: Iterative computation of relative page importance.
- System Integration: Combination of multiple data structures to form a functional search engine.
